                                <p>New updates have been recently launching actively in React Native for developers to have strong tools, excellent performance, and seamless integration. In this post we highlight what is new in the 0.75 release of React Native, including new features, speed improvements, and compatibility changes. In this article, let’s look at what has been added in React Native 0.75: TypeScript, animation, reanimated, bridge elimination, native compatibility with Kotlin, Objective-C, Java, and Swift.</p>

                                <h3>Enhanced TypeScript Support in React Native 0.75</h3>
                                <p>In the recent past TypeScript has also emerged as the go-to language for developers working with React Native because of its ability to provide strong typing which helps create better applications. The recent release of React Native 0.75. improves TypeScript more by simplifying the setup process and fixing some type errors.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    With the release of React Native 0.75, it is much easier to work with TypeScript within projects. The official suggestion is to utilize TypeScript for new applications and that’s the default option when setting up a new project with React Native. Getting back to the list, TypeScript introduces static typing which allows avoiding certain kinds of bugs in the course of development, and Increasing code readability. For getting TypeScript or updating with TypeScript, developers can follow a few of the basic steps such as adding necessary packages like @tsconfig/react-native and ensuring the right configuration tsconfig.json file.

                                <h3>Improved Animations and Reanimated Support</h3>
                                <p>Animation support has been the main area where lots of progress has been made in this release of React Native 0.75. This update also brings the improvements of the process that manages complicated animations in React Native, making it slicker and performing more effectively.
                                    <br />
                                    The components brought by the Reanimated 2 library in the RN 0.75 enable complex animations that are run on the native thread. This greatly minimizes use of the JavaScript thread, which still previously presented some of the worst performance issues. With the help of new native thread, animation computations are able to be split which in turn makes richer UI that works even if the frame rate is very high.
                                    <br />
                                    Reanimated 2 is an enhancement of the previous version and sees an easier way to define animations for developers, who do not necessarily have to understand the native syntax of an animation. Moreover, the new React Native 0.75 is better at syncing the JS thread with native animation to offer smoother interactive transitions.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Key Benefits:</h3>

                                <h3>Bridge Removal for Faster Communication</h3>
                                <p>Another major improvement made in React Native 0.75 that many developers will really appreciate is the absence of the JavaScript bridge. Earlier, this bridge connected the JavaScript thread with the Native Modules, or Modules created with a native language. Due to these constraints, this bridge often emerged as a critical performance limit for a number of applications, particularly for intricate applications.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Since the bridge, React Native directly accesses native modules, which makes it possible to create a connection between JS and Native far more quickly. This change significantly enhances speeds and yields even the best results with the application of complicated UI components or frequent data interchange between JavaScript and native components. With straightforward use of applications apparent by the absence of the need for the bridge, the developers are likely to experience better response to the apps and overall performance.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Native Compatibility with Kotlin, Objective-C, Java, and Swift</h3>
                                <p>React Native has always strived for better integration with native codebases, and React Native 0.75 takes this to the next level by enhancing its compatibility with key native programming languages: Kotlin, Objective-C, Java, and Swift.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Kotlin (Android): The latest version of React Native 0.75 enhances support for Kotlin-a relatively new programming language for that Android platform. This makes it easier for developers to integrate the React Native into the Android application that has been written with Kotlin and should allow one to update to the latest Kotlin syntax without running into problems.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Objective-C and Swift (iOS): Specifically for iOS developers, the released React Native 0.75 provides interoperability guarantees for the React Native apps with both Objective-C and Swift. It also makes it more compatible with current iOS projects and introduces new iOS-native possibilities.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    These enhancements enable developers to integrate React Native with native solutions better than before, minimizing overhead of maintaining two disparate technologies, and enhancing the total performance of the applications.
