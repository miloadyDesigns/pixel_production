                <p>Pixel Brain Designs refund policy will be nil if;

                    <br />

                    You have chosen a special package.
                    <br />

                    The primary design concept has been approved.
                    <br />

                    You have demanded revisions.

                    <br />

                    The cancellation has been made due to reasons non-related to the company.

                    <br />

                    The company has not been contacted for more than 2 weeks of project.
                    <br />

                    Company’s policies, or policy, have been violated.
                    Other company or designer has been approached for the same project.
                    <br />

                    The creative brief is lacking in required information.
                    <br />

                    A complete design change has been demanded.
                    <br />

                    The claim has crossed the given ‘request for refund’ time span.
                    <br />

                    The business is closing or changing name or business.
                    <br />

                    Reasons such as ‘change of mind’, ‘disagreement with partner’ or other reasons that do not pertain
                    to the service will not be subject to refund under any circumstances.
                    <br />
                    If a client subscribes for a service bundle and happens to be dissatisfied with a particular
                    service, refund will only be applicable on that particular service and ‘not’ the entire bundle.
                    <br />

                    The client will not be entitled to any refunds after 15 days, from the date of purchase.
                    <br />

                    Services including but not limited to Social Media, SEO, Domain Registration and Web Hosting are not
                    entitled to refunds under any circumstances.
                    <br />

                    In case of websites, refunds will not be entertained once the client has approved the design and the
                    website is sent for development.
                    <br />

                    Money-back guarantee will only be applicable if the initial designs are completely rejected by the
                    client.
                    <br />

                    If the said client(s) wants additional design concepts and/or requests amendments/modifications in
                    the original design, and requests refund (cancellation) on the placed order after this point, then
                    PBD will be entitled to deduct 33% of total billing amount for costs incurred in delivery of
                    services, which includes processing fee and management/service charges.
                    <br />

                    Note: PBD holds all rights to reject any project or cancel the contract whenever it deems necessary.
                    <br />

                    After the refund, you will not have any rights to use the designs for any purpose; they will be the
                    sole property of PBD. The company will be the rightful owner of the designs.
